Run the game through Eclipse. The main menu has some high
scores and splines right there (for testing). Click the first button to generate
a new world (it should have an island with procedurally generated coastlines).
Click and drag to pan around, scroll to zoom.
You can see various particles being drawn on the screen.
You can click on the buttons in the top right to add to/save the current high
score (right now saves with a name of "Default").
You can press the spacebar to spawn the first wave of ants.
