# Ant-Tower-Defense
## Final 2
This is the final 2 handin. The contents of the final 1 handin's README are 
included below. Notable new features are particles (seen in the game world), 
AI movement/behavior (again, in game world), and improved security for high 
scores. We started work on towers as well, but didn't get to completely 
finish work on squad tactics (though Jeff did a lot of the work he planned on
doing for next week as well). 

Most of the changes in scores are still in engine.scores. Particles can be
found in engine.world.particles. The new game objects can mostly be found 
in game.world.gameobject (and it's sub-packages). 

## Final 1
This is the final 1 handin. Notable features are Perlin noise-based world
generation, spline drawing (currently on the menu), and cheat-proof
scorekeeping. Other features that were added include hexagonal world coordinates
and animated tile sprites, among others.

Level generation can be found in the game.world.system package (I used some
open-licensed code for generating perlin noise, hope that's okay). Splines are
in the engine.ui package, and scores are in the engine.scores package.
