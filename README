# Ant-Tower-Defense
## Final 1

This is the final 1 handin. Notable features are Perlin noise-based world
generation, spline drawing (currently on the menu), and cheat-proof
scorekeeping. Other features that were added include hexagonal world coordinates
and animated tile sprites, among others.

Level generation can be found in the game.world.system package (I used some
open-licensed code for generating perlin noise, hope that's okay). Splines are
in the engine.ui package, and scores are in the engine.scores package.
