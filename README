# Ant-Tower-Defensei
## Final 5
Please look at the FINAL_README file for details. If you want more details on
specifics, you can look at the previous READMEs here. 

## Final 4
This is the final 4 handin. The contents of the previous readmes for are
included below. For this week, we are continuing to add more game elements.
We added more functionality for the honey (slowing ants down by 80 percent
when they walk on them), added water projectiles that kill ants in one shot,
a spider web tower, which after 2 seconds a spider "projectile" comes out and
removes the ant and spider. You can see information for these in various
subpackages in the game package, especially in game.world.gameobject.tower, and 
game.world.gameobject.projectile. We also set up most of the "squad dynamics."
You can look into game.world.gameobject.ant for most of the AI of the ants. 
You can also look at game.world.system for the Ant's system as well as more code for starting new waves. 


## Final 3
This is the final 3 handin. The contents of the previous final handins are 
included below. For this week, we began adding more game elements, e.g. 
functioning towers and an interface for adding them in. We also fixed an issue
with some lag caused by particles not being properly removed when we were done
with them.

Most of these changes can be found in game.world.gameobject.ant and 
game.world.gameobject.tower. Also there were changes to their respective
systems in game.world.system 
## Final 2
This is the final 2 handin. The contents of the final 1 handin's README are 
included below. Notable new features are particles (seen in the game world), 
AI movement/behavior (again, in game world), and improved security for high 
scores. We started work on towers as well, but didn't get to completely 
finish work on squad tactics (though Jeff did a lot of the work he planned on
doing for next week as well). 

Most of the changes in scores are still in engine.scores. Particles can be
found in engine.world.particles. The new game objects can mostly be found 
in game.world.gameobject (and it's sub-packages). 

## Final 1
This is the final 1 handin. Notable features are Perlin noise-based world
generation, spline drawing (currently on the menu), and cheat-proof
scorekeeping. Other features that were added include hexagonal world coordinates
and animated tile sprites, among others.

Level generation can be found in the game.world.system package (I used some
open-licensed code for generating perlin noise, hope that's okay). Splines are
in the engine.ui package, and scores are in the engine.scores package.
